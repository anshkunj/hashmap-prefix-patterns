# 🚀 HashMap & Prefix Sum Patterns

A curated collection of **HashMap and prefix sum algorithm problems** covering frequency counting, cumulative sums, and analytics challenges. Each solution is optimized, explained with examples, and mapped to real-world scenarios like log processing, data streams, and array manipulation.

## 🧠 Features
- Well-structured Python solutions  
- Optimized O(n) algorithms (no brute force)  
- Clear explanation of hashmap & prefix sum logic  
- ASCII diagrams showing algorithm flow  
- JSON-friendly examples where applicable

## 🏗️ How This Repo Works
- Each `.py` file contains a single problem solution  
- HashMap / prefix sum logic explained in **comments + diagrams**  
- Key patterns highlighted for **real-world applications**  
- Focus on cumulative sum, frequency counting, and O(n) optimizations  

---

## 📌 Problem Patterns Covered
- Subarray / substring sum equals K  
- Count pairs / triplets / quadruplets using HashMap  
- Duplicate detection & frequency counting  
- Prefix sum with constraints  
- Handling negative numbers and large inputs  

---

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/anshkunj/hashmap-prefix-patterns.git  
cd hashmap-prefix-patterns  

2. Open any `.py` file, read problem statement, and understand the logic  

3. Solve or adapt the code for your own projects  
   - Add diagrams  
   - Experiment with different frequency / prefix sum patterns

## 🧪 Example (Subarray Sum Equals K)

arr = [1, 1, 1]  
k = 2  
print(subarray_sum_equals_k(arr, k))  
# Output: 2  

- Uses prefix sum array + hashmap  
- Tracks frequency of cumulative sums  
- Achieves O(n) time complexity  

---

## 🚧 Edge Cases Handled
- Empty arrays / strings  
- Large input sizes (up to 10^5)  
- Negative numbers  
- Exact / at most K constraints  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- Standard libraries (`collections`, `itertools`)  
- Optional: Jupyter Notebook for visualization
